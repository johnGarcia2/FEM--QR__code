## Overview

This is a simple website with a QR code that directs a person to front end mentor's website. Website was created to have certain viewing characteristics on both mobile and desktop browsers.

## My process

I created a container inside the body that held the text and QR code image. In side the container I gave the two sets of texts and the image their own class to target. I added a border radius to the image and container, and some padding. I formatted the container to look like the desktop preview image, styled the font with the appropriate color, family, and weight. I added padding to the text classes until the matched the provided example. I used flex display and flex-direction column to get the content aligned properly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

I learned how to target specific content or items on the web page by giving them a class. I also learned how to add a google font to the web page. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I want to continue learning front end dev techniques to make simple and elegant websites that we can use on the shop floor. This helps us get visibility on problems in productivity and also highlight where our employees are knocking it out of the park. It's important to reward people for doing outstanding work!

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools, CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me by providing definitions and examples for some one the CSS syntax.
